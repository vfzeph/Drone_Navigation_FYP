# Drone Navigation Reinforcement Learning Project

This project implements reinforcement learning algorithms for drone navigation in a simulated environment. It includes scripts for training and evaluating reinforcement learning agents using proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Unity ML-Agents (mlagents-envs)
- PyYAML
- gdown (optional, for downloading files from Google Drive)

You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
